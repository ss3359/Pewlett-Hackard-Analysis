# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This is a project where we obeerve retirement elligibility for employees working at Pewlett-Hackard. 

# Overview
Pwelett_Hackard is a software company who has a numerous amount of employees about to retire from the company. We need to determine the number of retiring employees per title and look for employees who are eligible to enter in a mentorship program. Then, we give out solutions to the manager of Pwelett_Hackard for the upcoming "silver tsunami". The tool to conduct this project is pgAdmin, a software that enables us to write, and compile code in Standard Query Language (SQL).  

# Results 
The first set of data to obeserve is data collected from employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. There are some employees that have multiple titles in the database, which led us to refine the query creating a table that has the most recent job title for each empoloyee. Also, we count the number of retiremenent-age employees and eliminating the employees who have left the company. The SQL code to create this table is included in the file "Employee_Data_challenge.sql". Here is the first ten rows of the table created using said code.
